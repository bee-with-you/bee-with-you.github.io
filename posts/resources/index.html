Please include the name, severity, curvature, location of the opening, foreskin condition, and any possible associated abnormalities. It is usually recommended to get at least one second opinion if the case is not minor, as it can help with making a more thoughtful decision. Are there any tests that need to be done? For example, some endocrine tests may be ordered during mini-puberty (i.e., around 1–6 months after birth) to gain insights into the boy\u0026rsquo;s testosterone levels without external stimulation. Occasionally, a heart echocardiogram may also be performed to ensure the structure and function of the heart are normal.  Questions on the Doctors  How many hypospadias surgeries do you perform each year and over the course of your career? How many cases of similar severity to ours do you handle annually? Based on your diagnosis, will the procedure be a single-stage or staged operation? What is the success rate for each stage of the operation? What are the possible short-term and long-term complications? Who will perform the operation, and what are the responsibilities of each person involved? Will it be a single surgeon with an assistant, or multiple surgeons? Who can we contact before and after the operation for questions or in case of emergency, and how? What is your technique for correcting the curvature/chordee? Is it dorsal plication or ventral lengthening? What technique do you use to reconstruct the new urethra? For example, do you use the urethral plate, a skin flap, or a skin graft?  Questions on the Surgery  When is the proper time for us to do surgery for our specific case? How long will the catheter remain in place, and who can remove it? What will post-operative care involve? Is it recommended to undergo HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) before and after the surgery?  Other Questions  How long should we wait before traveling? What activities can and can\u0026rsquo;t be done, and for how long?

A fistula is a small hole that forms below the normal urinary opening after hypospadias surgery. It causes urine to leak from an abnormal site when the boy pees. They are one of the most common complications following hypospadias repair, and the complicate rate can vary from 4% to 25% or above depending on the surgical techniques, the hypospadias severity, the operation history, the healing status and so on.\nHere is an example picture of a fistula:\nWhen Does It Occur?  Most fistulas appear within weeks to months after surgery. Rarely, they may show up years later. Early signs include urine leakage from an unintended spot after catheter removal.  Common Locations Fistulas may develop anywhere below the normal opening, and many just appear just under the glans (penis head).\nAre There Other Accompanying Complications? While many boys with fistulas have no other complications, some may also develop:\n Persistent curvature (chordee) Urethral blockage beyond the fistula hole Ballooning of the new urethra during urination  These should be evaluated by your surgeon.\nTreatment Simple Fistulas  If tissue around the glans is well-healed:  Closure can often be done without a full redo surgery No catheter may be needed \u0026gt;90% success rate    Complex Fistulas  If there are additional issues (e.g. curvature, scarring, poor healing):  A redo hypospadias repair is required May involve catheter use and/or skin grafting    Follow-Up Always schedule follow-up visits after surgery. If a fistula or any abnormal urination is noticed, contact your urologist promptly.\nReferences  Operation Happenis  CHOP - Hypospadias Overview  Fistula Picture Example  Fistula Complication Rate  Fistula Risk Factors   ","pubDate":"2025-03-15","title":"Surgery Complications: Fistula"},{"link":"https://bee-with-you.github.io/posts/postop-care-scars/","plain":"Many parents worry about scarring after surgery. This post explores non-invasive ways to minimize scar tissue following hypospadias surgery. Always follow your doctor’s advice regarding post-op scar care.\nMethods to Reduce Scars Post-Surgery Following your physician’s instructions is crucial for effective scar prevention. While many patients heal naturally without intervention, some may require consistent treatment for months to see improvement. Possible methods include:\nHyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) HBOT involves breathing 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber (1.5–3 times normal air pressure) to treat oxygen-deprived tissues (e.g., the tissues near the surgical site). It boosts oxygen levels in the blood, promoting healing and potentially reducing scarring. HBOT may be used before and after surgery to support faster recovery.\nSteroid Cream Steroid creams are widely used for pathological scar prevention and treatment. They reduce collagen production and inflammation, helping to minimize scar volume and alleviate itching and discomfort. The following picture is an example of steroid cream we were prescribed and instructed to use since about one month post surgery.\nScar Creams Scar creams aid skin regeneration, promoting smoother healing. Their effectiveness varies by ingredients:\n Silicone Gel: Creates a controlled environment that prevents excessive collagen buildup, reducing keloid formation. Plant-Based Ingredients: Ingredients like allantoin and onion extract hydrate the skin, soften scar tissue, and support regrowth.  For recommended scar creams, refer to:\n The 8 Best Scar Creams to Fade Unwanted Scars  The Best Scar Creams and Treatments, According to Dermatologists   Additionally, regular scar massage and moisturization can help improve flexibility and appearance.\nTypes of Scars Understanding your scar type helps determine the best treatment approach. The two main difficult-to-heal scars are:\nHypertrophic Scars  Appear as red, raised, thick scars within the original wound boundary. Result from damage to the deeper skin layer (dermis). Usually improve naturally over 1 to 2 years.  Keloid Scars  Extend beyond the original wound area. Can become elevated, shiny, firm, and change color over time. Less likely to resolve completely without treatment.  Wound Healing and Scar Formation Phases Initial Inflammatory Phase (0 to 5 days)  Blood vessels constrict to form a clot, stopping bleeding. They then expand to deliver nutrients, white blood cells, and antibodies to the wound, aiding infection prevention and repair.  Proliferation Phase (4 days to 3 weeks)  The body rebuilds skin using collagen-rich tissue. New skin forms, and the wound’s appearance reflects healing progress. Proper wound care is essential for optimal recovery.  Maturation or Remodeling Phase (3 weeks to 18+ months)  Scar tissue gradually softens, flattens, and becomes less visible. Excess collagen is broken down and reorganized. The process may take up to two years, depending on individual healing factors.  Healing is not always linear; wounds may fluctuate between the proliferation and remodeling phases. Ideally, healing progresses from deeper layers to the surface. Regular scar massage and moisturization can help enhance flexibility and reduce visibility over time.\nReference  HBOT introduction  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the effect of keloid surgery and radiotherapy by reducing the recurrence rate  Top Treatments and Natural Options for Scar Removal  Understanding scars and effective care  The Differences Between Keloid \u0026amp;amp; Hypertrophic Scars  The application of corticosteroids for pathological scar prevention and treatment current review and update   ","pubDate":"2025-02-10","title":"Minimizing Scarring After Hypospadias Surgery"},{"link":"https://bee-with-you.github.io/posts/resources/","plain":"This post collects the resources and support that are related to hypospadias.\nGetting To Know About Hypospadias   Hypospadias and epispadias association   Operation happenis   PISSED: Parents Improving Support, Surgery, Education, and Diligence with Hypospadias   Support Groups Facebook support groups One needs to search the following keyworkds in Facebook to find them, and choose to join the interested ones.\n  Hypospadias Parent Support Group (Pro-surgery and Pro-choice)\n  Hypospadias and Epispadias Association (HEA)\n  Hypospadias \u0026amp; Penile Birth Defect Support\n  Hypospadias Surgery Support\n  Real Support \u0026amp; Education for People with Hypospadias/Epispadias/Chordee\n  Dr. Snodgrass/Dr. Bush Hypospadias Support Group\n  Reddit Support Groups One can search the keyword of interest to find related groups to join, and the following one is so far the most related group.\n r/hypospadias   Books And Research Papers   How Down There Bear Got Repaired by Deb Smith, 2024\n  No Margin for Error: A Surgeon\u0026rsquo;s Struggle Repairing Hypospadias by Dr. Warren Snodgrass, 2023\n  Living with hypospadias by John Filippelli, 2021\n  Hypospadias: A guide to treatment: The definitive guide for parents with boys born with hypospadis by Matt Dorow, Dr. Suzan Carmichael, and Dr. Bill Kennedy, 2013\n  ","pubDate":"2024-07-28","title":"Hypospadias Resources Collection"}];
